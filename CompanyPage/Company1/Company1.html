                            However, as the story unfolds, he develops into a multifaceted figure who confronts his past
                            and seeks redemption. He saves Shinra from her Infernal Mother, loses faith in Holy Sol Temple
                                after uncovering Evangelist's involvement, sends Joker to investigate Haijima Industries, arrests Obi,
                                defeats Shinra with Joker's help, and attacks Infernal from the shadows. His journey entails sacrifice and leadership development,
                                and it ultimately changes the outcome of the story, adding complexity to it.</h3>

He wears a light overcoat-like garment with a high collar and dark cassock and carries a cross-like pendant instead of bunker gear. Karim's growth is characterized by loyalty, determination, and intellectualism, as he uses musical instruments and headphones in warfare.

He also carries a bell, which makes startling noises while reducing heat and collecting it for his instrument.
