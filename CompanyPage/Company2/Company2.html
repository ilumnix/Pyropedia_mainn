Gustav, a skeptical scientist who relies on empirical facts, gains a new perspective after working with Company 7. He grows personally by developing close friendships and experiencing the human side of Infernals, questioning his ideas and blending scientific knowledge with spiritual understanding, ultimately becoming a more empathic and open-minded individual.

For formal events, he wears a dark cape and a headgear ornamented with a cross-shaped insignia. Throughout the series, he matures via his friendship with Shinra, talent improvement, overcoming adversity, and embracing collaboration, eventually becoming a valued part of his squad.
