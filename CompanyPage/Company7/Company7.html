                        <h3>Benimaru Shinmon is a young man with a light complexion, neck-length wavy black hair framing his face, and startling red eyes—one with a black dot pupil and the other with a white X-shaped pupil. Benimaru is first shown as a reclusive and skeptical leader in the Special Fire Force, but he develops significantly throughout the series. His backstory is slowly revealed, shedding light on his protective impulses for the inhabitants of Asakusa. Over time, he discovers the importance of teamwork, trust, and emotional connection, evolving into a more open-minded and adaptive leader who relies on others, demonstrating his personal and professional development. He usually wears a white t-shirt with a black vest, a gray kimono upper-garment over his left arm, and Special Fire Force uniform trousers tucked into black boots, and previously wore black fingerless gloves and a sweater tied around his waist.

                        <h3>Benimaru, also known as "Asakusa's King of Destruction," is regarded as the Special Fire Force's most powerful officer. He easily defeats numerous powerful opponents, including his doppelgänger, saving the Earth with a single touch. He teaches Shinra and Arthur, unlocking their abilities, especially Hysterical Strength. Benimaru excels at hand-to-hand combat, having mastered iaido martial arts. He is extremely fast, strong, and durable, with an incredible resistance to poison.

                        <h3>Konro Sagamiya, a tall man with black hair pulled back in a ponytail and a scar between his nose and eyes, wears a gray or black kimono. Tephrosis scars on his shoulders, as well as charred skin and bandaged arms, indicate his tragic history. Initially serving as a mentor figure in "Fire Force," Konro overcomes physical constraints and fears with the help of his friend Benimaru and tutelage from Shinra. His journey is distinguished by bravery and selflessness in the face of peril, which has led to his status as a recognized hero inside Company 7.

                        <h3>Konro's Third Generation ability energizes his shoulders and forearms, increasing his punching power. Even without it, he could destroy an Infernal's core via raw force. Overusing his Ignition Ability resulted in Tephrosis, making him unable to fight. His abilities force him to fall quickly after activation, particularly if he has not fully healed. In his prime, his firepower rivaled Benimaru's Crimson Moon technique, which he inspired. He could make gigantic holes, which usually required enormous destructive energy, such as when killing a Demon Infernal.

With their large black eyes and flame motifs on their sleeves, they symbolize allegiance to the brigade. Throughout "Fire Force," Hinata progresses from a timid rookie to a confident firefighter, while Hikage shifts from solitude to forming strong bonds with her team, displaying vulnerability along the way. Their character development showcases resilience and growth in the face of adversity.
