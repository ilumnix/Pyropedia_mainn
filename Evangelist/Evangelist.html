Despite her brutality, she has sympathy for Charon, who has shown her unconditional love. Haumea has been with the Evangelist for most of her life and was charged with abducting Shō Kusakabe, the Third Pillar, at the age of five. Her Adolla Burst activation caused mental strain, which triggered her cruel tendencies as a coping mechanism.

His body could resist severe injury and heal swiftly. Charon's Second Generation talent allowed him to absorb kinetic energy from assaults and turn it into thermal energy, resulting in massive explosions. With minor gestures, he could redirect this energy and produce many forms of explosions. However, he was unable to absorb and release energy at the same time, making him vulnerable to attacks. There was a limit to how much energy he could absorb; deflecting a nuclear explosion from Nataku drained him, while receiving repeated blasts from Hinawa killed him. Despite this, Charon shown amazing competence against formidable pyrokinetic fighters like as Kurono and Shinmon, earning the latter's respect as a "monster."
